# Rationale and Research Questions

Question:

_*STEP 1: Have methane emissions gone up?*_

* Create time series of methane produced by one or two livestock for general trend
+ Use CH4 emissions variable â€“ want to see if the gigagrams of methane have increased over time 
+ Filter for one element for time series?

_* STEP 2:*_
Specifically:

* Is there a difference in rate produced by each animal? Looking for statistical difference between the rates of different livestock
+ Run an ANOVA test - check whether or not there is a significant difference between livestock 
+ Use the Implied emissions factor variable 
+ Make fancy summary tables
