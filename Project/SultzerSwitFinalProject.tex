\section{Rationale and Research
Questions}\label{rationale-and-research-questions}}

For this project, we were interested in manure management and greenhouse
gas emissions created by livestock. Our initial dataset considered
methane, nitrous oxide, and carbon dioxide. Research revealed that
``livestock are reckoned to be responsible for up to 14\% of all
greenhouse emissions from human activities'' (BBC article). With such a
substantial amount of human activities, we wanted to see how livestock
factored into emissions. When considering different emission types, we
focused on methane because methane is a very detrimental greenhouse gas:
it traps heat at a rate 25 times greater than carbon dioxide (Watts
2019). Methane gas explored here is produced by the anaerobic
decomposition of manure stored or treated. Our research and data
availability led us to these two research questions:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Question 1: Have methane emissions changed over time?
\item
  Question 2: Does the average methane emissions rate differ between
  each animal category?
\end{itemize}

\section{Dataset Information}\label{dataset-information}}

The dataset used for this project was retrieved from the Food \&
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), specifically from
FAOSTAT. FAOSTAT provides free access to statistics pertaining to
agriculture for over 245 countries. For this analysis, we focused on
emissions in the United States. \emph{more info on how data was

\hypertarget{data-wrangling-steps}{%
\subsection{Data wrangling steps}\label{data-wrangling-steps}}

First, we viewed a summary of our data to decide how to pare it down and
wrangle it.

We wanted to make our dataset more manageable, so we filtered for the
specific columns we wanted to retain, the variable we were interested in
(methane emissions), and only focused on historical data.

In order effectively conduct a time series analysis, we made all the
different livestock their own variables. We used the pivot\_wider
function to separate the livestock from the Items column into separate
variables with their associated methane emission values. This allowed
separate time series to be run on the desired livestock species.

\hypertarget{basic-visualizations}{%
\subsection{Basic visualizations}\label{basic-visualizations}}

First, when considering our first research question, we wanted to see
how methane emissions appear over time. When combining all animals, we
can see there is a general increasing trend over time (Figure 1).
However, there is a sharp decrease in methane emissions at the beginning
of the dataset (\textasciitilde1980-1985) that might warrant
investigation later. For our analysis, we wanted to investigate whether
this trend was significant.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{SultzerSwitFinalProject_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-2-1.pdf}
\caption{Methane Emissions Over Time}
\end{figure}

We were also interested in the total emissions per animal. We visualized
total methane emissions for each animal from 1980-2018 (Figure 2). It is
evident that dairy cattle and market swine had the highest emission
rates.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{SultzerSwitFinalProject_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-3-1.pdf}
\caption{Methane Emissions by Animals}
\end{figure}

Our second research question focused on the different emission rates
between animals. We were curious about this question when we explored a
boxplot showing the different rates (Figure 2). According to this
boxplot, we suspected that there might be statistical differences since
for, example: dairy cattle and market swine had higher rates than
others.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{SultzerSwitFinalProject_files/figure-latex/viewing boxplot of methane by animal-1.pdf}
\caption{Average Methane Emissions by Animal}
\end{figure}

Additionally, to understand how the number of animals can influence
total methane emissions, we visualized how head of animals differed
between livestock category.Total livestock was visualized in Figure 4.
To control for the the higher proportion of chickens, we removed them
from the plot in Figure 5.

\section{Analysis}\label{analysis}}

\hypertarget{research-question-1}{%
\subsection{Research Question 1}\label{research-question-1}}

To answer our first research question, we conducted a time series on the
overall methane production for all livestock. Since methane was only
calculated once a year, there was no seasonality to our data, and we
were not able to decompose our time series. However, we conducted a
Mann-Kendall test, which confirmed that there was a significant trend
(p-value \textless{} 0.05). From our data exploration, we can say that
overall the trend is increasing: methane emissions between 1980 and 2018
have increased across 13 livestock in the United States.

From visualizing the total emission rates, dairy cattle and market swine
showed the highest emission rates. We also decided to conduct a time
series analysis to determine if there was a significant trend. The
Mann-Kendall test confirmed that a significant trend was present for
both animals (p-value \textless{} 0.05). Dairy cattle (Figure 7) had an
overall negative trend in emissions while market swine had a positive
trend (Figure 8).

\caption{Methane Emissions of Market Swine}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{research-question-2}{%
\subsection{Research Question 2}\label{research-question-2}}

To answer the second research question, we conducted a one-way ANOVA
test to evaluate whether the different animals, on average, have
different emission rates. To begin this process, we had to test the
emission rates for normality. The important assumption for generalized
linear models is the normality of residuals. The Shapiro-Wilk test
showed that, of the 13 livestock, only ducks, breeding swine, and market
swine were normally distributed. When viewing a Q-Q plot, once can see
the data does not follow a normal distribution (Figure 3). Lastly,
Bartlett's test for homogeneity of variances was run, which revealed
that the variances were not equal (p \textless{} 0.05). Even though all
of the tests for normality failed, we proceeded on with the analysis.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{SultzerSwitFinalProject_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-4-1.pdf}
\caption{QQ plot}
\end{figure}

Our analysis then revealed that there was a significant difference in
mean emissions among animals (ANOVA; F: 4394 on 12 and 494
DF,p\textless0.05). But which animals had different means? A Tukey's HSD
test helped show which means were different between the animals. We
extracted groupings for pair-wise relationships where the letters in
Figure 4 represent the different groupings. Thus, asses, ducks, goats,
mules, and sheep all had statistically similar emission rates (Figure
4). Most of the other animals, such as market swine and dairy cattle,
have their own grouping.

\includegraphics{SultzerSwitFinalProject_files/figure-latex/anova results-1.pdf}

\end{figure}

\newpage

\hypertarget{summary-and-conclusions}{%
\section{Summary and Conclusions}\label{summary-and-conclusions}}

With approximately a tenth of all methane emissions coming from manure
collections ponds, amounts of manure must be considered and properly
managed (Horn, 2018). To summarize, we investigated how methane
emissions changed over time and how they differed between livestock. Our
analysis revealed a significant upward trend in emissions over time
across all selected livestock in the USA. The animals with the highest
emissions, dairy cattle and market swine, exhibited significant trends
with dairy cattle decreasing and market swine increasing from 1980-2018.
A one-way ANOVA test confirmed that there were significant differences
in methane emission rates between animals. The Tukey's HSD test resulted
in 8 groups, with asses, ducks, goats, mules, and sheep being paired in
the lowest emitting group. Dairy cattle and market swine had their own
groups and were the highest emitters.

Further analysis could include researching the decrease in total methane
emissions between \textasciitilde1980-1985. Within this dataset,
additional research avenues include assesing trends in other green house
gases, including nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide emissions. Our
research did not include methane emissions from non-manure sources,
including cattle burping. However, recent strides in research includes
innovative solutions to reducing methane produced and emitted by
livestock. Such innovations include burp backpacks, and vaccinations for
reducing methane producing microbes(Bustamante, 2008).
