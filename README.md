## Summary

The purpose of this document is to provide background information for the repository containing the Data Analytics project conducted by Kendra Sultzer and Nadia Swit in the spring of 2021.  This project focused on analyzing the trends within manure management over livestock in the United States. Analysis goals included identifying how methane emissions have changed over time and how methane emissions over time are different between different livestock.This repository contains datasets, code, project files, and presentation files.  

<describe the purpose of this repository, the information it contains, and any relevant analysis goals. What, why, where, when, how?>

## Investigators

* Kendra Sultzer, Duke Nicholas School of the Environment's Master of Environmental Management Candidate 2021, kendrasultzer@gmail.com, co-author  

* Nadia Swit, Duke Nicholas School of the Environment's Master of Environmental Management Candidate 2022, nadswit@gmail.com, co-author

## Keywords

manure, manure management, methane, livestock emissions

## Database Information

Data for this project was obtained from the United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).  Specifically, this information is from FAOSTAT, which contains food and agriculture statistics for more than 245 countries. Years of study for this dataset ranged from 1980-2050.  Consecutive years were 1980-2018 and then 2030 and 2050 years were predicted values. This data was last updated in 2020 and was downloaded in April 2021. 

<describe the origin of all data in the repository, including data collected from outside sources and new data generated by the investigator(s). If data was accessed from an outside database, the date(s) of data access should also be included.>

 
## Folder structure, file formats, and naming conventions 

Folders within this repository are as follows:

* Code: contains .RMD files with R code from project and one knitted .PDF

* Data: contains processed and raw subfolders with datasets in .csv form. In the raw folder, there are also metadata files associated with the raw data, including Def_Element.csv, Def_Item.csv, FAOSTAT_data_Metadata.csv, and MoreMetadata.pdf. The processed folder contains a few .csv files from filtering the raw dataset. 

* Output: contains .PNG picture files used in class presentation

* Project: contains a variety of file types used for class presentation and final report. These include .PPT, .RMD, and .DOCs.

## Scripts and code

The code files can be found in the "Code" folder.  Data_Processing.RMD was where data wrangling and filtering for the project was conducted. Data_Exploration.RMD was where we explored the data visually and numerically. Data_Analysis.RMD was where we conducted our time series analysis and ANOVA test.

## Quality assurance/quality control

After examining our data, we did not feel that any QA/QC procedures needed to be taken.
