knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

```{r}

```{r, importing data}
Poop_raw <- read.csv("./Data/Raw/FAOSTAT_data_1980_2050.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

summary(Poop_raw)
```
```{r, paring down data}

Poop_filtered <- Poop_raw %>% 
  select(Area, Element, Item, Year:Flag.Description)

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
