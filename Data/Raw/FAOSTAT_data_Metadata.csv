To make the coverage of this data collection as complete as possible, official data have sometimes been supplemented with data from unofficial sources. Use has also been made of information supplied by other national or international agencies or organizations"". All countries are covered with various degrees of completeness depending on the country, the year and the livestock. Aggregated emission estimates (by country, by livestock) necessarily reflect this."
14.1,Main Sources of Error,Overall accuracy,"Accuracy in estimates of GHG emissions depend on the accuracy of activity data and  emission factors as well as on the choice of methodology.  FAOSTAT emission estimates are based on standard IPCC methodology and emission factors at Tier 1 (reckoned the simplest of methods). Inaccuracy may be due to, inter alia, generality of algorithms, natural variability, partitioning fractions, lack of spatial or temporal coverage, spatial aggregation. See 11.2 and 20.5 In the case of manure management, more detailed information is available in the IPCC 2006 guidelines, Vol. 4, Ch. 10, Section 10.5.5 (http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/4_Volume4/V4_10_Ch10_Livestock.pdf)"

20.1,Identification Data,Source data,"For the period 1961-– 2018, activity data are derived directly from FAOSTAT domains Production/Live animals (http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QA) and Production/Livestock Primary (http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QL). Projections of activity data for 2030 and 2050 are computed with respect to a baseline, defined as the 2005 – 2007 average of the corresponding FAOSTAT activity data, and by applying percentage growth rates from FAO perspective studies (Alexandratos and Bruinsma, 2012). Activity data for animal categories for which FAO projections were not available were set to the most recent available FAOSTAT value. The FAO projections used cover some 140 countries. Projections of activity data for countries not included assume the same growth rate of neighboring countries.  Conversion factors are taken from IPCC 2006 guidelines (http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol4.html). A complete description of the methodology is available under the ""Related documents"" section of the FAOSTAT domain Manure Management."

20.5,Identification Data,Data compilation,"When no activity (source) data is available, FAOSTAT emissions database results in no data (i.e. no imputations are made) . GHG emissions from manure management consist of methane and nitrous oxide gases from aerobic and anaerobic decomposition processes. The FAOSTAT emission data are computed at Tier 1 following IPCC, 2006, Vol. 4, Ch. 10 and 11. The term manure includes both urine and dung (i.e., both liquid and solid material) produced by livestock. More specifically, CH4 gas is produced by anaerobic decomposition of manure stored or treated, while N2O is produced directly by nitrification and de-nitrification processes in the manure, and indirectly by nitrogen (N) volatilization and re-deposition processes, as well as from leaching of manure N.   CH4 emissions are estimated at country level, using the formula:  Emission = A * EF  where: Emission = GHG emissions in kg CH4 yr-1; A = Activity data, representing number of livestock in heads (1); EF = Tier 1, default IPCC emission factors, expressed in kg CH4 head-1 yr-1 (2).  (1) Activity data cover the following animal categories: buffalo, sheep, goats, camels, llamas, horses, mules, asses, ducks, turkeys, dairy and non-dairy cattle*, chickens layers and broilers** and market and breeding swine***.   For the period 1961-present, activity data are taken directly from FAOSTAT (domain: Production/Live animals). Projections of activity data for 2030 and 2050 for the following categories: dairy and non-dairy cattle, buffaloes, sheep, goats, pigs and poultry, are computed with respect to a baseline, defined as the 2005-2007 average of the corresponding FAOSTAT activity data, and by applying percentage growth rates from FAO perspective studies (Alexandratos and Bruinsma, 2012). Activity data for animal categories for which FAO projections were not available were set to the most recent available FAOSTAT value. The FAO projections used cover some 140 countries. Projections of activity data for countries not included assume the same growth rate of neighbouring countries.  *FAOSTAT livestock data include the items cattle and dairy cattle. Dairy cattle data are expressed as heads of cows producing milk, and can be found under the domain Production/Livestock Primary by selecting the item milk, whole fresh cow and the element producing animals. Non-dairy cattle is derived from FAOSTAT categories, specifically as cattle minus dairy cattle;  **FAOSTAT livestock data include the items chicken and chicken layers. Chicken layers are expressed in 1000 heads of hens which have laid eggs in the reference period, and can be found under the domain Production/Livestock Primary by selecting the item eggs, hen, in shell and the element producing animals. Chickens broilers is derived from FAOSTAT categories, specifically as chickens minus chickens layers;  ***FAOSTAT livestock data include the item pigs. Market and breeding swine are calculated respectively as 90% and 10% of item pigs (IPCC, 2006, Vol.4, Ch.10, Tab.10.19).  (2) The EF values are assigned to each country (IPCC, 2006: Tab. 10.14 for cattle, buffaloes and pigs and Tab. 10.15 for all other animals), as a function of country-level average annual temperature (°C). Average annual temperatures by country are taken from the FAO Global Agro-Ecological Zones (GAEZ) dataset (IIASA/FAO, 2012), relative to the baseline period 1961-1990.   Direct N2O emissions are estimated at country level, using the formula: Emission = A * EF  where: Emission = GHG emissions in kg N2O-N yr-1; A = Activity data, representing the total amount of N in manure treated in manure management systems (MMS) in kg N yr-1 (3);  EF = Tier 1, default IPCC emission factors, expressed in kg N2O-N/kg N yr-1 (4).  (3) It is the total amount of N excreted (i) for each livestock categories (ii) treated in MMS (iii).  (i) Following IPCC, 2006: Vol. 4, Ch. 10 Eq. 10.30, the total amount of N excreted by each livestock category is calculated multiplying the number of livestock heads by two coefficients: a) the Typical Animal Mass (TAM) and b) the N excretion coefficient (Nex). Both parameters vary according to geographic region. TAM values are obtained from IPCC, 2006: Vol.4, Ch. 10, Annex 10A.2, Tabs. 10A-4 to 10A-9; Nex values are derived from IPCC, 2006: Vol.4, Ch. 10, Tab. 10.19.  (ii) see (1) for the livestock categories.  (iii) Default IPCC percentages of total N treated in different MMS, by region and livestock category, are taken from IPCC, 2006: Vol.4, Ch. 10, Annex 10A.2 Tabs. 10A-4 to 10A-9 (for poultry: IPCC, 1997: Ch.4 Tab. 4.21).   (4) The EF values depend on the specific MMS, as per IPCC 2006, Vol.4, Ch. 10, Tab. 10.21.   Indirect N2O emissions are estimated at country level, using the formula:  Emission = A * EF where: Emission = GHG emissions in kg N2O-N yr-1; A = Activity data, representing the fraction of total amount of nitrogen (N) in manure treated in MMS that volatizes as NH3 and NOx and is lost through runoff and leaching, in kg N yr-1 (5);  EF = Tier 1, default IPCC emission factors, expressed in kg N2O-N/kg N yr-1 (6).  (5) The fractions for volatilization by animal and MMS are taken from IPCC, 2006: Vol. 4, Ch. 10, Tab. 10.22. A mean fraction value of 10% for all countries is used for leaching (IPCC, 2006: Vol. 4, Ch. 10, note to Eq. 10.28).  (6) All countries are assigned global default EF values for volatilization and leaching (IPCC, 2006: Vol. 4, Ch. 11, Tab. 11.3).  Dimensionless conversion factors used are: 44/28, to convert the emissions from kg N2O-N to kg N2O gas; 10-6, to convert kg to Gg; and GWP-CH4 = 21 and GWP-N2O = 310 (100-year time horizon global warming potential), to convert Gg CH4 or Gg N2O to Gg CO2eq.
